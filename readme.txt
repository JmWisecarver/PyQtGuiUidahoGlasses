	Second, you enter the three values for red, green, and blue that you want the glasses to shine as
	Third, you click on the grid to assign the address to the color you want it to be.
	
	Fourth, you decide the amount of time in milliseconds you want the pattern to display for.
	Fifth, you click on "save pattern" which will save the colors and the addresses you have assigned them to into a temp file.
	Sixth, you go to "file" on the top left and click on save as and name the file you are saving
	Finally, you go to "file" once again and click on "convert to ht13" and pick the file you want to make into an ht13 file. It will ask if the pattern is a repeating one and what keybind you want to assign the pattern to.
